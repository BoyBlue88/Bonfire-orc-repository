# Modpacks
This folder contains complex mods that may consist of multiple NPCs relying on external data, such as macros, scripts, or tattoos.

To install these mods, simply extract them into your `\AppData\LocalLow\Prasetto\Bonfire` folder. These Mod Packs mirror the
folder's stucture, and contain an `activemods.json` file that will ensure that the necessary NPCs are automatically enabled.
