# Obsolete Orcs- These orcs had a good run but due to changes or updates these ones are retired versions and are preserved for posterity and examples of how the game has changed over time. Please consider updating an orc before requesting an older copy be placed in this section. 

### Make sure your version of the game meets or exceeds the version listed in the BAB file otherwise the NPC may not function properly.


**PLEASE MAKE SURE TO FILL IN THE AUTHOR FIELD AND DESCRIPTION SO PEOPLE KNOW WHAT YOUR NPC DOES**
