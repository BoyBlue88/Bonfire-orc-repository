# Bonfire-orc-repository
Storage of Orcs and NPCs for Bonfire game currently in development by Hogswild. NPCs and orcs are made for the currently released version of the game. Please support the official release. 

**Custom orcs** refer to binary files that only contain data that allow the player to play as that orc

**NPCs** refer to orcs that have dialog trees and various interactions with the player and exist within the world.

**Tattoos** are various mapped images other users have created that can be added to orcs.

2. Click "Refresh" and the menu will fetch a list of available NPCs
3. Scroll to the NPC you want to download, and click "Summon"
4. Click the checkbox to make an **X** mark, and click Done.
