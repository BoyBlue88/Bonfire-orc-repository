# Bonfire-orc-repository
Storage of Orcs and NPCs for Bonfire game currently in development by Hogswild. NPCs and orcs are made for the currently released version of the game. Please support the official release. 


**Custom orcs** refer to binary files that only contain data that allow the player to play as that orc

**NPCs** refer to orcs that have dialog trees and various interactions with the player and exist within the world.

**Tattoos** are various mapped images other users have created that can be added to orcs.

# How to download from this repository
1. Find the orc or NPC you wish to download, so that it either displays the code for that orc (and a Raw button at the top of it) or a Download button at the top. 
2. If theres a download button click that. If it displays Raw instead, right click the button in your browser and select "Save Link as"
3. If the ending of the file isnt .orc or .bab (or .png in the case of tattoos) this isnt the file you are looking for.
